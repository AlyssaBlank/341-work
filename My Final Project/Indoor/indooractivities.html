     <h3>Types of Indoor Activities</h3>
     <p>
       Some of the greatest things about being a kitty guardian occur during play time.
       Indoor kitties love to spend their days lounging in cat trees or burrowing under blankets for nice naps.
       As a guardian, you can certainly entertain both yourself and your kitties with a variety of activities indoors.
       One of the most popular, but not the most healthy for your kitty, is playing with a laser pointer. The kitty doesn't get the satisfaction of catching prey, though.
       Playing with a string of feathers on a stick is also near the top of the list in popularity and also can give your kitties the satisfaction of catching prey.
       It is important to provide indoor perching areas for your kitties; these areas make kitties feel safe and allow them to satisfy their need to jump and climb.
       Lastly, you could provide various self-interacting toys and stations, such as a running wheel, to promote indoor kitty activity and health.
