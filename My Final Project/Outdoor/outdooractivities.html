     <h3>Types of Outdoor Activities</h3>
     <p>
       Some of the newer frenzy with kitties lies in the outdoor activities.
       Outdoor or leash-trained kitties enjoy the natural world just as much as humans and dogs.
       The key thing to remember when taking kitties outdoors is that they can escape; a good fence that does not allow climbing is a necessity, for starters.
       Growing in popularity is cat-leashing.
       This practice allows for guardians to walk with their cats.
       Another activity that guardians can enjoy with their outdoor kitties is going for a hike. Just remember to keep a close eye on the kitties.
       Taking kitties on day trips, such as a beach trip, can be fun and exhilarating for both you and the kitty.
       It is imperative that outdoor kitties are watched and vaccinated to prevent certain diseases and cancers found in the outdoor world.
