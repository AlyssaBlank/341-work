     <h3>Basic Information About Kitties</h3>
     <p>
       Kitties are fun, cuddly companions.
       They are in the felidae family of the animal kingdom.
       Other cats in this family include tigers, panthers, and cougars.
       A typical house kitty can live up to 20+ years, but would only live 4-5 years in the wild.
       Conversely, tigers can live up to 26 years in the wild, due to their ability to hunt and survive.
       The scientific name of a house kitty is felis catus.
       The commonly accepted number of different house kitty breeds is 70.
       Cats are a carnivorous mammal that feature senses honed to their predatory nature.
       Cats were first believed to have been domesticated in Egypt.
       Coming second only to freshwater fish, cats are among the most popular house pet in the U.S.
       Most house cats typically weigh in around 9-10 pounds; however, some breeds, like the Maine Coon, can weigh up to 24 pounds.

        House cats can also breed with feral cats, creating various differentiations in breeds.
        An example of this is the Kellas Cat, which has been thought to be able to river swim and catch salmon.
        To prevent unwanted breeding and overpopulation, as well as adding more friendliness to kitties, owners should spay or neuter their cats.
