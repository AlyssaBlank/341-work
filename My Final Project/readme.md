My final project will have a main page discussing Kitties and some basic info about how to take care of them. It will feature some subpages on activities, both indoor and outdoor, as well as a photo page and contact page.

Rough Sketch:
![Site Layout](https://github.com/AlyssaBlank/341-work/blob/master/My%20Final%20Project/imgs/sitelayout.PNG)

1. Summary <br>
  I created multiple levels of folders for my files and images.
  I created my wireframes to help guide me through the completion of my site.
  I ensured that the site layout would work. Then, I found my font type for the site and began to select colors.
  I struggled with linking photos at various levels throughout my site, but overcame that difficulty in the end.
  I added various photos, both in the background and throughout the photos page.
<br><br>
2. Styling <br>
  I chose complimentary colors that were soft, to match the them of kittens. I found the paralax scrolling effect extremely difficult to achieve; however, I used Google and previous weeks' instruction to help sort through the difficulty. I did my best to match the navigation theme throughout the different pages.
  <br> <br>
3. Trials and Successes<br>
  The most difficult part of this site was the linking of both the sites at different levels, as well as the photos. Once I figured out the main page, things came together. I found success in the paralax scrolling effect and fitting the page to different sizes.
  <br><br>
4. Future Work <br>
  The amount of info that I have learned this semester is unprecedented; I am hoping to be able to better understand Content Management Systems that manage my business site in the future. With this background knowledge of HTML and CSS, I believe I should have a fundamental understanding of websites in the future.

5. Resources <br>
  I found all of my images on Google.
