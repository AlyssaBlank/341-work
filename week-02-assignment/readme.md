## 1.
This homework cycle I set up Atom, GitHub, and began to familiarize myself with Powershell.
      - I chose GitHub primarily because it syncs so seamlessly with the online portal and I already had a username on the site.
      - I found the integration between Atom and GitHub to be excellent as well.

## 2.
I completed the assignment by using some background knowledge in command prompt as setting these programs up for the first time was not something I am familiar with at all. Creating directories and files within a text editor is entirely new to me, so I relied heavily on the steps given.

## 3.
My biggest issue this week was really a simple mental biff. I couldn't get my changes to commit within Powershell because I was editing the wrong text document. It just happened to hav the same name, differnt directory. I solved it by simply correcting my file choice within Atom. I didn't really post anything about it because I resolved it so quickly; however, I certainly viewed others' work to compare what I had done.

## 4.
Particularly, the command prompt-styled language and text editing is entirely new to me. I don't fully understand how what we are learning this week applies into web design, but I think I'm beginning to grasp it. The text editor works on the actual code; GitHub tracks changes and easily allows movement between versions and also posts committed changes to published versions online.

## 5.
I can't say that I am really reliable when it comes to helping others in these topics; however, I think I am at a point where I could help others install the necessary programs to get this process started.
