        <h2>Irwin Mercer</h2><br />
        <p>I once knew a man who lived in a jar.<br />
          For a stranger sight you'd have to go far.<br />
          I asked him once why he lived in a jar.<br />
          He grimaced and said, how bizarre you are.<br />
          <br />
          My jar's so cozy, warm and bright,<br />
          Even in the full moonlight.<br />
          The only drawback is, you see,<br />
          Getting out quickly when I have to pee.<br /></p>
