## Week 3 Homework Report
### Introduction
This homework cycle I began working on my first website utilizing Atom and GitBash. It was a fantastic experience, watching the code transform into actual webpage content.

## 1.
Some of the primary techniques that were shown this week were entirely unfamiliar to me. I am really enjoying learning code and how it integrates into an online webpage.

## 2.
My biggest issue this week was again a simple mental mess-up. I couldn't get my webpage to go 'live'. This was because I hadn't loaded my changes into GitHub. I corrected it by dragging and dropping my updated index.html file into GitHub.

## 3.
I found again that the integration between Atom and GitHub has been near seamless and that it has made my introduction to webdesign a very good one. Google has been a huge help with the coding language when I hit a wall. Because of this easy integration and easily-found references, I think I will find myself advancing quickly.
