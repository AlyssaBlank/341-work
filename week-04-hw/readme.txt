This week I spent a great deal of time learning the basics of what I consider to be an HTML paragraph. The process took me longer than anticipated this week.
I learned about lists, both unordered and ordered. I also continued learning and applying links. Something that I found particularly useful this week was learning to add a photo to the websited.

When it came to my difficulties this week, I found adding the image was more difficult than it should have been. I simply didn't know the right file extension.
This lead to the highlight of my week, which was being able to see the image in my page, with my recipe.

This week, I pulled help from other's websites, their trials and triumphs, and learned a bit more of the expectations of a website's documentation. Per the usual, I used internet resources to help expedite my learning.

Next week, I look forward to making more additions to a site and hope to better understand html in general.
