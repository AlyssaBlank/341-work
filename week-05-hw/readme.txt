This week I furthered my skills as a website designer. I pushed myself to apply all that I have learned throughout this
course and go above and beyond what I expected.
As for trials and triumphs I would say figuring out how to add a GIF was easier than I expected. I initially made it harder
than it needed to be by questioning if I could even download a GIF in the first place. One I figured that out, it was easy.
This week I utilized the past week's assignments/ website information as well as the internet. I was able to troubleshoot my
bumps in the road with online question and answer posts.
One issue I had was centering the Header of the page with the body, but that was due to trying to center the title of the page,
not the actual heading.
Going Forward I am excited to learn how to make my website more interactive and in depth. Starting off I was very nervous about
this class, but now I look forward to learning more!
