I read the chapters of this weeks assignment and googled anything
that I needed further explaining on. I had a lot of fun with this
assignment because I got to share my cute cats with everyone. I like how
creative this process Is becoming and I am excited to dive into more styling.

As for my trials and triumphs I feel like I am getting this code stuff down more
 and more each assignment. I still don't feel like it clicks just yet but I am
 slowly getting it! One thing I ran into this week was when I tried to apply a
 background color to one of my pages, it overlapped my text. I have not found why
 quite yet but I am investigating.

 Going forward, I am eager to learn more about the styling aspect. I feel like it
 will be a great tool for my future career to know how to make an appealing website.
