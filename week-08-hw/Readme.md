For this assignment and CSS in general. I felt the same as when I entered HTML for the first time.
It was very overwhelming having to learn CSS all of the sudden, but I think I began to grasp it towards
the end of my assignment. I found that CSS was easier to pick up on, now that I know HTML. I spent a great
deal of time going back and forth between my notes, homework, and the lecture pages. It was awesome to
learn some of the ins and outs of CSS and how to add your personal touch to a webpage.

I found myself on the other end of helping this week. I really need help understanding how to link the
various documents together. The documents themselves, once labeled correctly, were amazing. It is
very cool to see how they come together and create a full webpage. I learned the most about linking
CSS and borders this week.
