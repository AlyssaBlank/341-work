    <h1 class="main-heading">Katara and Moose Overcome All Odds in Quest for Home!</h1>
    <p class="intro">Throughout the cold winter of 2016, Katara and Moose, the great house kitties of the northwest, set out
       on a wondrous journey to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missoula,_Montana">Missoula</a>.
       The story of their journey to Missoula is a great one!</p>
    <h3 class="katara-heading">Katara</h3>
    <p class="body text">
      The great kitty <em>Katara</em>, was first sighted on Facebook. Her
      beautiful hair and playful nature were the most adorable features.
      After a long week, Katara's personality had done her best to captivate
      her new audience. She was soon to find new hope with her new family! With just
      days to wait until meeting them, Katara contniued to play with her puppy friends,
      who taught her a silly habit of chasing her very long tail. Katara was picked up in
      Coeur d'Alene, where she stayed with her host family that rescued her from the streets.

    <h3 class="moose-heading">Moose</h3>
    <p class="body text">
      <em>Moose</em> began his great journey in Pinehurst, Idaho. He started life as
      an outside cat that would have to defend himself. His worst enemies in the
      outdoors world were: wolves, large birds like eagles, bears, and coyotes!
      Without them, Moose may have lived a simply life outside, hunting mice. But,
      Moose's destiny was to become a big tabby kitty that lives to eat, indoors.

    <h3 class="together-heading">Together!</h3>
    <p class="body text">
      The great kitties' next journey brought them together on a cold winter night.
      Katara was picked up first, and traveled to Moose's home next. Moose, offended
      by the other kitty's presence, hid in the back seat all the way to Missoula! He
      must have thought he was the superior kitty.

    <h3 class="pals-heading">Pals Forever</h3>
    <p class="body text">
      The following encounters were definitely a stressful few weeks at their new
      home, for Moose wanted to be the top kitty. Katara, however, was not letting it <body>
      happen at all. The kitties Moose and Katara, kitties of the great Missoula, <thead>
      Montana. Now, Katara and Moose are practically brother and sister, with all their lives
      ahead of them and much kitty chow to eat. There is nothing better than <em>Kitty Pals</em>
      that can keep you company at any time!
