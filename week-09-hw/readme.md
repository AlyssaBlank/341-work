## Week 9 Homework
-----------
### A simple website...

This week I chose to utilize kitties again for some content on this week's homework. I found that this simple website was very difficult for me to create due to the high amount of elements going into it.

### Troubles

The most challenging part of this week's homework was definitely the drop down menu and getting the 'logo' to sit within the header. Also, the high amount of divs really threw me for a loop. Despite spending copious amounts of time on the CSS and index, I was able to do a bit of writing for content, as well as enjoy myself while completing the site. It feels great to see something through to completion.

### Color/Font Choice

I found that choosing a pastel lavender for the background and complementing it with some stark colors goes with kitties well. I enjoy vivid colors, which is why I went for the brighter teals against the lavender. I chose the Pavanam font style because it is relaxing to read and isn't hard on the eyes.

### Screenshots

I spent a great deal of time writing the code this week, so I thought I would screenshot some of it for your viewing. I also was able to add an icon to the tab title, which I found really cool; you can see the little kitty icon in the tab of my page.
